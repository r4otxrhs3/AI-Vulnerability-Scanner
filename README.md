Idea: 
AI Vulnerability Scanner 'WoxCan', is a all-in-one vulnerability scanner. This will have two versions, one exclusively for technological developers and the others for users. 
Technical features:
  For professional edition:
    We know, an average e-commerce website is built by two ways: through CMS systems like Laravel, Wordpress, Elementor, Laravel, etc. or by developing a full-stack site. Let's discuss on each type of technology and the points our app focuses on: 
  ;CMS systems: 
Our application mostly focuses on AEM based vulnerabilities, i.e. Adobe Experience Manager based vulnerabilities that usually targets wordpress plugins. What we have developed is a plugin scanner for CMS system that scans the CMS site for aem-based vulnerabilities in the backend server itself. Our application also focuses on OWASP Top 10 bugs, however AEM security is not much talked about and also contributes a lot of zero days, so we've exclusively kept AEM in mind. 

  Other e-commerce sites:
  Our main focus on other e-commerce sites are as follows:
  1. On e-commerce sites, products are uploaded using Kubernetes and Docker containers. very little to no importance is given to the cloud-based vulnerabilities of these containers. According to a research paper we refered to, Kubernetes is exploitable and DDos attacks can be carried out by these. Hence, we put our primary focus on the security of these Kubernetes container. We initially decided to go with Project Calico API, however it's not within the scope of this project's budget so we've considered this as a future prospective of improvement for this project. 
  2. AI Malware Analyser: We trained an AI malware analyzer based on an open-source data-set with around 40,000+ .exe and .dll files and 20,000 legitimate files to train the dataset to detect malware automatically when a file is uploaded to the server. It is a self-updating dataset that keeps frequently adding zero-days to itself so no need to update. 


User end:
*Extra features that we've added for user ends*
1. Stocks API: A lot of times, people are fooled into investing in stocks that are failing and are conned into parting with their money. So we've implemented an optional feature for finance enthusiasts to check stock values and details each day directly for NSE (National Stock Exchange) so that they're aware.
2. Fake Website checker: A key factor to checking fake websites is that fake websites won't be indexed on search engines the way original websites do. To check this, we've implement Google Search Console API to check indexing status of the website and tell if the site is fake or not.
